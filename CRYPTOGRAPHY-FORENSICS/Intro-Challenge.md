# Challenge Write-up: CryptoHack - ASCII

## 🛠️ Phase 1: Building the Foundation
Before attempting the challenge, I realized I needed to understand how Python handles data. I spent time documenting the core fundamentals (Variables, Loops, and Functions) to ensure I could write my own scripts instead of relying on online converters.

**My Reference:** [Python Fundamentals & Cheatsheet](CRYPTOGRAPHY-FORENSICS/Python-Cheatsheet.md)

## Phase 2: Solving the Challenge
The challenge provided a list of integers: `[99, 114, 121, 112, 116, 111, 123, ... 125]`.

### My Logic
1. I recognized that these numbers represent **ASCII values**.
2. I needed a way to transform these integers back into human-readable characters.
3. The problem specified that the `chr()` function is designed for this exact task, which was then added to my cheatsheet
